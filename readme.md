# OOP in Java

this is a small repository to learn the basics of OOP in Java.
its based of a oop module from my studies in computer science, which was made in c++

## Tasks

the [tasks](./tasks/) subfolder contains every task in its own task folder.

every task folder contains a code basis with the explanation for the task in the top comments
and a output file with an example how the console output should look like if its done correctly

## structures

the [structures](./structures/) subfolder contains help for different structures

these help files typically explain how to work with a specific structure and link a reference
to look up other properties you might need to complete the tasks
